# Deep-Learning-Project

# There are three ipynb files
- one for a logistic regression image classification
- one for a sequential neural network for image classification
- one for a transfer learning neural network for image classification. 

Please note: All the work done for this project was done in Google Colab and it was my first time using that service so it seemed like some libraries were already installed/imported so please be sure to double check to import any that you need to use if trying to replicate. Also, the image import was from my personal Google Drive so don't forget to add the images to your own Google Drive or your personal machine or import from Kaggle directly. 

The goal of this project was to use deep learning techniques to correctly classify fish images.  This project was started in hopes to help anyone needing to classify fish accurately from any image. Some example uses of the project could be for game wardens to correctly identify fish by submitting their own test images to the model or for dietitians to identify a fish and look up nutritional information to build a meal.

This project was something I wanted to do when I found a nice dataset of fish images because I have always been intrigued by image classification.  In the modern world many applications of this technology are becoming relevant (such as airport facial recognition, self driving cars, etc) and I think that more hands-on jobs (like fish and wildlife jobs) should not be left out of having that type of technology.

For the transfer learning, I tried InceptionV3 and VGG-16 and VGG-16 performed marginally better for my data so I decided to utilize it.
